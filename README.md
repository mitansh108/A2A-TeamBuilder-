# A2A SDK Demo Projects
This repository contains example projects demonstrating the capabilities of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) SDK. Each sub-directory is a self-contained project with its own dependencies and instructions.

### 2. Friend Scheduling Multi-Agent Demo (`a2a_friend_scheduling/`)

This is a more advanced example showcasing a multi-agent system. It demonstrates how a "host" agent can orchestrate a conversation between multiple "friend" agents to accomplish a goalâ€”in this case, scheduling a meeting. This project is ideal for learning about multi-agent orchestration and communication.

**>> For setup and run instructions, see the [Friend Scheduling README](./a2a_friend_scheduling/README.md).**
